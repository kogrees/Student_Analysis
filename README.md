# Student_Analysis

General insights :-
  Students with fewer resources attend school more regularly, likely because they rely on school for learning due to a lack of resources at     home
  Despite fewer resources, students with low access score higher on exams, possibly driven by a greater motivation to excel
  Students living closer to school achieve higher exam scores and better attendance. Proximity to school appears to reduce barriers to 
  learning and improve academic performance
  Internet access provides a significant academic advantage, with more students able to achieve high scores when they have access to online     resources
