General Insight :-

Access to resources: Students with fewer resources attend school more regularly and score higher on exams, possibly due to increased reliance on school for learning.

Distance from home: Closer proximity to school leads to better attendance and higher exam scores, reducing barriers to academic success.

Internet access: Students with internet access perform significantly better, with more students scoring above 80%, highlighting the importance of online resources.

Learning disabilities: While learning disabilities slightly reduce exam scores, they have a much larger impact on attendance, indicating barriers to consistent school engagement.

Parental education: Higher parental education correlates with better scores, but high-performing students are found across all levels of parental education.

Exam scores (previous vs. final): Final exam scores are lower but more balanced, with fewer students scoring extremely high or low compared to previous exams.

Motivation: Students with medium motivation study the most, suggesting a balanced approach to effort and time investment yields the best outcomes.

Teacher quality: Better teacher quality leads to higher exam scores and reduced study time, indicating that effective teaching enhances learning efficiency.

School type (public vs. private): Public school students tend to score higher, though the difference in success rates between public and private schools is small.
